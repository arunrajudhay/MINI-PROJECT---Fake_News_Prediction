# MINI-PROJECT---Fake_News_Prediction

## Dataset : [Fake News Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv)

## Introduction :
The Fake News Prediction project focuses on classifying news articles as real or fake using Logistic Regression. The process involves preprocessing the data through techniques such as stop words removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization to extract meaningful features from the text. The Logistic Regression model is then employed to predict the authenticity of the news articles. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated to ensure accuracy and reliability in identifying fake news, addressing the critical issue of misinformation in today's digital landscape
